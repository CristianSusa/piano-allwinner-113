# Piano with Dev Board LCPI-PC-T113
This piano is a college project for Embedded Systems and Electronic Systems Design. It uses the LCPI-PC-T113 development board with the Allwinner T113s chip running embedded Debian. The project includes the design of the PCB as well as the design of the enclosure. Notes on the development process are also included.

## Contents
Within this repository, you will find two folders:
* embedded-systems-development
* electronic-system-design

These folders serve as a step-by-step guide on how to construct the piano. They include files, construction notes, and suggestions for improvements in future versions.

Enjoy :D
